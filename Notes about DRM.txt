Notice about DigitalRightsManagement (the class file):

	Provided with this source release is an...incomplete...version of DigitalRightsManagement.
It will allow the source code to be built, run, and properly tested, however it will not provide any DRM functionality.
In the final release, this version shall be swapped with a functional version of DigitalRightsManagement, which will
provide DRM functionalities such as encryption. Therefore, continue keys from source versions of Shoot'Em will NOT be
compatible with binary release versions. If you so desire, you may decompile the binary release versions in order to
see the functional version of DigitalRightsManagement, however you should be aware that all versions containing functional
DRM will also be obfuscated. Therefore, as a nod to developers, two binary releases of Shoot'Em will be made. One that is
unobfuscated, and does not contain DRM, and another, that is obfuscated, but that will produce continue keys compatible with
the final game and all other DRM-enabled versions. If the code of DigitalRightsManagement is leaked in unobfuscated form,
and the key and IV information made available via hacking, both of these will be immediately changed, and the released with
compromised security will be removed from my Github. Feel free to fork my project, if you really want to play around with a
cracked DRM version, however I will always (at least for a very long time) release a version without DRM as well.
Apologies for this,
Andrew Athalye
